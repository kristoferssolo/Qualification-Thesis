    _"Maze Ascension" is a minimalist maze exploration game built using the Bevy
    engine. The game features simple visuals with hexagonal tiles forming the maze
    structure on a white background with black borders, and a stickman-style player
    character. Players navigate through multiple levels of increasing difficulty,
    progressing vertically as they climb up through levels. The game includes
    power-ups and abilities hidden throughout the maze, and later introduces the
    ability to move between levels freely._
